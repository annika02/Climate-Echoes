## Overview
**Climate Echoes** is an interactive, animated platform that visualizes global climate teleconnections using NASA’s Terra satellite data. The project transforms complex climate interactions—like the effects of El Niño—into engaging, human-centered visualizations. By connecting global climate events to local impacts, the platform empowers communities, researchers, and educators to understand and act on climate change.
